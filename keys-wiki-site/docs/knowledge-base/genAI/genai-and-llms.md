# GenAI and LLMs

## Generative AI

Generative AI is a subset of Deep learning that uses models to perform human-like tasks.

## LLMs

LLMs (Large Language Models) are a type of generative AI model that uses transformers to generate text.

Prompts and Completions:

- **Prompts** are the input to the model.
- **Completions** are the output of the model.
- For example, if the prompt is "Hello, how are you?", the completion is "I am fine, thank you!".
- The act of generating text using models is called **inference**.

Use Cases:

- **Text Generation**: Generating text based on a given prompt.
- **Text Completion**: Completing the text based on a given prompt.
- **Text Summarization**: Summarizing a text.
- **Text Translation**: Translating a text from one language to another. Or Translating natural language to code.
- **Text Question Answering**: Answering questions based on a given text.
- **Entity Extraction**: Extracting entities from a text.
- **Flight Information**: Connecting the LLM to an external source.

## Generative AI Project Lifecycle

1. **Scope**: Define the scope/user case of the project. Generation, Named Entity Recognition, etc.
2. **Select**: Start with an existing model or train a new model.
3. **Adapt and Align Model**
   - **Prompt Engineering**: Design the prompt to get the best out of the model. In context learning, few shot,
     zero shot, etc.
   - **Fine Tuning**: Fine tune the model on a specific dataset.
   - **Align with Human Feedback**: Align the model with human feedback.
   - **Evaluate**: Evaluate the model performance. The process is highly iterative.
4. **Application Integration**: Connect the model to the application.
   - **Optimize and deploy model for inference**: Optimize the model for deployment.
   - **Augment model and build LLM-Powered Application**: Augment the model and build an LLM-Powered Application.
     Reduce the tendency to hallucinate.
